## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Cross-modal Conditioned Diffusion Model, which is designed to address the challenges of incomplete multimodal learning. The model leverages retrieval mechanisms and cross-modal conditioning within a diffusion framework to effectively learn from and generate multimodal data even when some modalities are missing or incomplete.

## Features
- **Retrieval Mechanism**: Enhances the learning process by retrieving relevant information from external sources to supplement the incomplete modalities.
- **Cross-modal Conditioning**: Allows the model to condition the generation of one modality on another, facilitating more coherent and accurate multimodal learning.
- **Diffusion Framework**: Utilizes the powerful capabilities of diffusion models for generating high-quality and diverse multimodal outputs.
